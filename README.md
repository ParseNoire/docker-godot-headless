# Godot Engine (headless) Docker image

Repository for building minimal Docker images with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Based off work from [abarichello/godot-ci](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci), which is more feature-filled. This version will be developed alongside my personal projects and features/targets will be supported as needed by my personal projects.
